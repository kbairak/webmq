# Adoption strategy

1. Polish the Core (Pre-Launch)

   Documentation

   - Add a "Why WebMQ?" page comparing to alternatives (Socket.io, Ably, Pusher)
   - Create architecture diagrams showing message flow
   - Add troubleshooting guide (common errors, how to debug)
   - API reference needs examples for every method

   Examples

   - Real-world apps people can actually run and understand
   - Notifications system (backend broadcasts, frontend shows toast)
   - Collaborative editing (simple shared text editor)
   - Live dashboard (metrics updating in real-time)
   - Chat with rooms/private messages (more complete than basic-chat)

   Developer Experience

   - Quick start should be copy-paste runnable in 60 seconds
   - Video/GIF showing it working (people love seeing it in action)
   - CodeSandbox/StackBlitz templates for instant experimentation

2. Community & Visibility

   GitHub Optimization

   - Great README with badges (build status, npm downloads, license)
   - Topics/tags: websocket, rabbitmq, real-time, pubsub, messaging
   - Clear contribution guidelines
   - Issue templates (bug report, feature request)

   npm Package

   - Publish to npm (currently local packages only)
   - Good package.json metadata (keywords, description)
   - Semantic versioning from day one

   Content Marketing

   - Blog post: "Building a real-time chat in 30 lines with WebMQ"
   - Blog post: "Why we built WebMQ (the RabbitMQ advantage)"
   - Blog post: "Scaling to 10k concurrent WebSocket connections"
   - Post to: dev.to, Medium, Hacker News, Reddit (r/node, r/javascript)

   Show HN

   - Hacker News "Show HN" post (time it well, weekday morning PST)
   - Need compelling title: "Show HN: WebMQ – WebSockets + RabbitMQ for reliable real-time apps"
   - First comment should explain the "why" clearly

3. Strategic Partnerships

   Compare to Alternatives

   - Create comparison table: WebMQ vs Socket.io vs Pusher vs Ably
   - Be fair but highlight unique advantages (RabbitMQ reliability, self-hosted, free)

   Integration Examples

   - Next.js example (huge community)
   - Express + React template
   - NestJS integration (enterprise users)

   RabbitMQ Community

   - Post in RabbitMQ forums/mailing lists
   - RabbitMQ Summit talk? (if they have one)
   Production Stories
   - Get 1-2 early adopters
   - Case study: "How X company handles Y users with WebMQ"
   - Even your own projects count

   Stability Signals

   - Version 1.0 (semantic versioning commitment)
   - Changelog
   - Security policy
   - Maintenance commitment statement

5. Distribution Channels

   Week 1:

   - Publish to npm
   - Post on Reddit r/node and r/javascript
   - Post on dev.to with good tutorial

   Week 2:

   - Show HN (if you got good Reddit traction)
   - Cross-post to Medium
   - Share on Twitter/X (tag @nodejs, @RabbitMQ)

   Week 3-4:

   - Submit to JavaScript Weekly newsletter
   - Submit to Node Weekly newsletter
   - Post in relevant Discord/Slack communities

   Ongoing:

   - Answer questions on StackOverflow (tag: webmq)
   - Engage with issues/PRs quickly
   - Update examples based on user feedback

## Critical Success Factors

Quality bar:

- Zero critical bugs in first release
- Tests must pass reliably
- Examples must work first try
- Documentation must be accurate

Response time:

- Answer GitHub issues within 24 hours
- Fix critical bugs within days
- Show you're actively maintaining

First impression:

- README is make-or-break (30 second test: can someone understand it?)
- Quick start must be actually quick
- "It just works" feeling

What NOT to Do

- ❌ Launch before it's polished (you only get one launch)
- ❌ Compare unfavorably to Socket.io (be realistic about trade-offs)
- ❌ Promise features you don't have yet
- ❌ Ignore feedback (even negative)
- ❌ Over-engineer (solve real problems, not imagined ones)

## Timeline Suggestion

1. Month 1: Polish

   - Fix any known bugs
   - Complete documentation
   - Add 2-3 more examples
   - Write comparison content

2. Month 2: Soft Launch

   - Publish to npm
   - Post on smaller communities (Reddit, dev.to)
   - Get initial feedback
   - Fix any issues

3. Month 3: Hard Launch

   - Show HN / Product Hunt
   - Newsletter submissions
   - Blog post series
   - Track metrics (npm downloads, GitHub stars)

The goal isn't viral growth - it's finding 10-50 people who actually use it and give feedback. They'll tell you what's missing and what works well.
